- Overly paranoid and socially anxious, please don't take offense if I hide or ignore you.
- Usually AFK bc we're drawing or doing something. You can whisper us.
- Okay with skin inspo/color-picking, but please try not to copy it code-for-code. I don't own colors or items, but I'd prefer to had my own skins.
- Don't roleplay with us unless we have the roleplay icon selected (rarely) or are in a roleplay (also rarely)
- We work a job as of now and I'm busy with life so I cannot be on social media 24/7! Please expect slow replies!

- I hate the terns "factive" and "fictive" and ask that you use the term introject.
- Our medical history is none of your business.
- If we find out you're a minor on 18+, we will permahide you for our safety. No, we will not unblock you until we feel safe.
- I don't talk about my BPD much so don't expect me to put it everywhere except my discord, github, and talklife account.
- We have a lot of introjects from "edgy sources" so expect to see Jeff the Killer in the same room as Hank J. Wimbleton and Pinkamena.
- Ask for our interests
