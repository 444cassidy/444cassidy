# BYI / INFO YOU SHOULD KNOW
- Overly paranoid and socially anxious, please don't take offense if I hide or ignore you.
- Sometimes I go "nonverbal" or whatever online and only respond with nods and headshakes. I am not nonverbal online, however, and wish to not be referred to as such.
- Usually AFK bc we're drawing or doing something. You can whisper us.
- Let me know if I end up bothering you.
- Okay with skin inspo/color-picking, but please try not to copy it code-for-code. I don't own colors or items, but I'd prefer to had my own skins.
- Don't roleplay with us unless we have the roleplay icon selected (rarely) or are in a roleplay (also rarely)
- As of now, sexual jokes make us uncomfortable, so please refrain from these jokes around us (freaky jokes do not count as of now)
- We work a job as of now and I'm busy with life so I cannot be on social media 24/7! Please expect slow replies!
- I ship almost everything and I'm a multishipper. If it's legal, consensual, and looks nice, I ship it probably. If this makes you mad, then uhm.. dni ig?
- We self-ship ourselves with fictional characters but we legit do not care if you like those same characters. I believe in my wife having another lover!
- We kin characters, but we dont gaf if you also kin that characters. Doubles don't exist in our eyes, both fictkin and introjects. (We'll respect if you have a doubles dni tho /gen)
- We don't have a system name so just use our collective names.
- I don't harasser shippers unless you're shipping illegal or immoral content such as minor x adult, siblingcest, etc etc. That being said, we are NOT a proshipper. Idc if "that's the def", we are NOT a proshipper. /vvgen
- We split easily, please be patient if a fragment or newer alter fronts, but please note; we are NOT polyfragmented due to being an OSDD-1B system.
- Fine with being asked system questions.
- I hate the terns "factive" and "fictive" and ask that you use the term introject.
- We cannot recieve medical help for a diagnosis on our OSDD-1B, HOWEVER, we have done research for 2 years, have gotten multiple legal documents, read multiple resources, and have consulted our main doctor on our problem. We plan to recieve help, but as of now, we are too poor and are currently trying to get insurance so we don't have to pay for mental health help.
- We believe kinks are natural and are not disgusting. While we do not feel comfortable with topics such as these, we also believe kinkshaming isn't right or a valid response to kinks.
- We believe people SHOULD be able to heal if they so choose to. For some reason people believe you HAVE to be ill to have a problem??
- We believe byi and dni lists CAN be long! Who cares how long it goes, be free!
- I'm objectum and POSIC and I love my computer platonically. She's the bimbo rich girl to my emo heartbroken boy. Balloonicorn!! She's my companion!
- Keep in mind, we're a stoner. We get high sometimes.
